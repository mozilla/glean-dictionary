This is a starter template for a metric annotation. You can add whatever
freeform markdown you think might be helpful to someone looking at this metric:
this could be a set of notes, links to dashboards or reports which use this
metric, or whatever you like! Bear in mind that the Glean Dictionary is visible
to the public, please do not share information about Mozilla's partners which is
under NDA. It's ok to put in links that require SSO or authentication, but
please mark them as such.
