# Glean Dictionary

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/glean-dictionary.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/glean-dictionary)

The Glean dictionary aims to provide a comprehensive index of datasets generated
inside Mozilla for newer applications using the
[Glean SDK](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/index.html).

This project is under active development and documentation is presently
incomplete. For now, please see the
[project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OkTWA3rsSJ0m5g9GDnxXVUMkJP-xJMQk_bDgDq-Z9xM/edit#heading=h.jwawftif1tt5)
for more details on the Glean Dictionary's ambitions and goals.

## Getting Started

You should be able to create your own local copy of the dictionary so long as
you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8) and
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Follow these instructions:

```bash
# Create and activate a python virtual environment.
python3 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build data needed by dashboard
./scripts/build-glean-metadata.py

# Install npm dependencies and start a local
# instance of the GUI
npm install
npm run dev
```

If that worked, you should be able to see a local version of Glean at
http://localhost:5000

## Storybook

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for developing and validating
Svelte components used throughout the app. To view the existing list of stories,
run:

```bash
npm run storybook
```
